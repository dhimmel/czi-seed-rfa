### Description (750 words TOTAL)

1. Loyal Goff
2. Stephanie C. Hicks is an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She is an expert in statistical methodology with a strong track record in processing and analyzing single-cell genomics data, including extensive experience developing fast, memory-efficient R/Bioconductor software to remove systematic and technical biases from scRNA-seq data [@doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxx053]. Dr. Hicks will work together with Co-PIs to implement fast search algorithms in latent spaces (Aim 1) and to implement the methods developed into fast, scalable, and memory-efficient R/Bioconductor software packages (Aim 3).
