## Proposal Body (2000 words)

* Base enabling technologies:
  * Low dimensional representations (Elana)
  * New methods published by other groups (scVI, etc -  other groups)
  * Fast & improved quantification  (Rob)

### Aim 1

* Fast search: (in low dimensions, quantifying differences between case and reference maps, twist: shared latent spaces / k-mers)
  * Differences b/w maps (Stephanie)
  * New models for UMI deduplication accounting for transcript-level information (Rob)
    * Parsimony & likelihood based, integrated with gene-level uncertainty
  * Everything FAST! API for search against HCA reference? (Rob)
  * k-mer / quantified latent spaces (Casey / Rob)

### Aim 2

* Transformation of latent spaces
  * Search tool for perturbations / signatures in latent-space(s) (Loyal)
  * Latent space transformations for progression? Consider jawns for semi-supervised learning? (Elana)
  * Transfer of signatures _between_ tissues (Loyal)

### Aim 3

* Reference Cell types
  * Cell-type summarized expression profiles (Mike, Loyal)
  * Versioning & provenance of cell types as the reference dataset changes (Mike)

* Delivery
  * Training / teaching (scRNAseq, low-dimensional representations, RFA-developed tools) (Tom)
  * Software hardening/testing (Casey - software eng)
  * Bioconductor integration (Stephanie, Mike)
